# [BasicState](https://clockworksquirrel.github.io/BasicState/)
BasicState is a really, really simple key-value based state management solution. It makes use of [BindableEvents](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BindableEvent) to allow your projects to watch for changes in state, and provides a simple API for communication with your state objects. Think [Rodux](https://roblox.github.io/rodux/), but much more simple.
